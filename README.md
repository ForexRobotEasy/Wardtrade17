## Description

The Wardtrade17 Expert Advisor is designed to trade the EURUSD currency pair on the 1-hour timeframe (H1) during specific trading hours aligned with Cairo time. The EA performs several checks before executing trading logic, including account balance, trading hours, and potential returns.

### Expert Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the following steps are performed:

1. Set the trading symbol to 'EURUSD'.
2. Set the trading timeframe to 1 hour (H1).
3. Set the UTC offset to 2, aligning the trading hours with Cairo time.
4. Check if it's Monday.
5. If it's Monday, check if the current time is within the trading hours.
6. Check if the account balance is sufficient (minimum deposit required is $500).

### Trading Logic

If all the conditions are met, the trading logic can be executed. This section is indicated by the comments 'Execute trading logic here' and 'Place buy/sell orders'. 

The specific trading strategy and implementation details are not provided in the code. Traders are encouraged to refer to the official developer or conduct further research to understand the trading logic used in the Wardtrade17 Expert Advisor.

### Potential Returns

After the trading logic is executed, the potential returns are calculated based on the account balance and an assumed annual profit range of 10%. The potential return is checked to ensure it falls within a specified range (between 10% and 42% of the minimum deposit).

### Print Trading Results

If the potential return is within the specified range, a message is printed indicating a successful trading operation and displaying the potential return. Otherwise, a message is printed indicating that the potential return is not within the specified range.

### Expert Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is provided for any necessary cleanup actions that may be required when the Expert Advisor is stopped or removed from the chart.

### Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is empty in this example, indicating that no action is required on each tick.
